Code for implementing thalamocortical learning models described in the following paper:

[**Specific connectivity optimizes learning in thalamocortical loops**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.509618v1)  
Lakshminarasimhan, Xie, Cohen, Sauerbrei, Hantman, Litwin-Kumar, Escola

For simulating the reaching task, you will need to download *bptt__reaching.pt*, which is a pre-trained rnn model used to generate the target function for training the thalamocortical model. Alternatively, you can generate this file locally by running *train_bptt.py* to train this rnn model from scratch. Feel free to reach out to me at jl5649@columbia.edu if you have questions.
